Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

**Making Blog Posts**: This is my Second blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
